About the CodeQL CLI
====================

Software developers and security researchers can secure their code
using the CodeQL CLI.

The CodeQL CLI is a command-line tool used to run CodeQL processes locally on
open source software projects. You can use the CodeQL CLI to:

- Run CodeQL analyses using queries provided by GitHub engineers and the open
  source community
- Create CodeQL databases to use in the CodeQL for Visual Studio Code
- Develop and test custom CodeQL queries to use in your own analyses

For information about using the CodeQL CLI, see 
":ref:`Getting started with the CodeQL CLI <getting-started-with-the-codeql-cli>`."

CodeQL CLI commands
-------------------

The CodeQL CLI includes commands to create and analyze CodeQL databases from the
command line. To run a command, use::

   codeql [command] [subcommand]

To view the reference documentation for a command, add the ``--help`` flag, or visit the 
"`CodeQL CLI manual <../manual>`__."
